# ChatGPT Everywhere ü§ñ ‚ú®

A Chrome extension that adds [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com) to every text box on the internet! Use it to write tweets, revise emails, fix coding bugs, or whatever else you need, all without leaving the site you're on. Includes a plugin system for greater control over ChatGPT behavior and ability to interact with 3rd party APIs.

## Install

First clone this repo on your local machine

Then install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

Run the server, so the extension can communicate with ChatGPT. This uses [chatgpt-api](https://github.com/transitive-bullshit/chatgpt-api/tree/main/src) and headless Chrome, but we can hopefully remove the need for this in the future.

```bash
node server.js
```

Add the extension

1. Go to chrome://extensions in your Google Chrome browser
2. Check the Developer mode checkbox in the top right-hand corner
3. Click "Load Unpacked" to see a file-selection dialog
4. Select your local `ask-chatgpt/extension` directory

You'll now see "Ask ChatGPT" if you right click in any text input or content editable area.

## Plugins

Plugins have the ability to inform ChatGPT of specific conversation rules and parse replies from ChatGPT before they are sent to the browser.

[Default](/plugins/Default.js) - Sets some default conversation rules üßë‚Äçüè´

[Image](/plugins/Image.js) - Tells ChatGPT to describe things visually when asked for an image and then replaces the description with a matching AI generated image from [Lexica](http://lexica.art) üì∏

Your really cool plugin - Go make a plugin, do a pull-request and I'll add it the list ü§ù
